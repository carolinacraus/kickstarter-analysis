# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The main purpose was to use Excel to analyze different Kickstarter fundraising campaigns to compare them in relation to their launch dates and funding goals in order to give Louise information and insights to help her plan and set up her first crowdfunding campaign to help her fund her play "Fever." In order to do this, we needed to organize, sort, analyze crowdfunding data wanted create visualizations based on our findings. 

## Analysis and Challenges


First, I separated the "Category and Subcategory" column into two separate columns called "Parent" and "Subcategory" in order to help us get a more in-depth look at the data/ In addition, I created two other columns called "Date Created Conversion" and "Date Ended Conversion" in which we used the given Unix timestamps and converted them into Short Date form to display the launch dates of the fundraisers. While the formula and conversion aspect of this part was not challenging, I still have trouble wrapping my mind around the concept of the Unix timestamps so I do not quite understand when an instance in which Unix timestamps would be more useful to use. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
